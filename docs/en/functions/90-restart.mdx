# Restart Instance

If the instance encounters operational failures, too many connections, or other unknown issues that cannot be identified during its runtime, the problem can be addressed by restarting the instance.

## Precautions

During the restart process, Pods will be restarted one by one, which may cause a brief interruption to the business.

## Prerequisites

The instance must be in the **Running** state.

**Note**:

- If the instance is in the **Processing** state, it indicates that the instance may be starting normally; please wait patiently.

- If the instance fails to start or is abnormal, meaning it is in the **Processing** or **Error** state, the instance will automatically restart after the health check times out; please wait patiently.
