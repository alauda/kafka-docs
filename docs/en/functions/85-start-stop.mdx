# Start and Stop Instance

The one-click start and stop feature meets the daily development and operation maintenance needs, allowing you to quickly pause or resume middleware instances. In scenarios such as scheduled downtime, heavy node load, and development testing environments, you may need to temporarily release CPU and memory resources without deleting instances. The one-click start and stop feature helps you save resources and flexibly manage middleware instances, thereby reducing costs and improving efficiency.
