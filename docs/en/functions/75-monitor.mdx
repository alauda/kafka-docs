# Monitoring and Alerts

The monitoring data embedded in the Grafana panel can be used for Kafka monitoring and alerting from the perspectives of resources, performance, etc., and supports configuring notification policies.

## Monitoring

The platform defaults to collecting commonly used monitoring metrics related to Kafka resources, performance, and capacity. Real-time monitoring data for various metrics is provided on the **Monitoring** tab of the instance.

<table border="">
  <tr>
    <th style={{width: '100px'}}>Category</th>
    <th>Metric</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><b>Resource Monitoring</b></td>
    <td>Memory usage, CPU usage, JVM memory usage, etc.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><b>Performance Monitoring</b></td>
    <td>Producer request rate, incoming message rate, etc.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><b>Others</b></td>
    <td>Log size, etc.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Alerts

The platform supports using the general alerting features. By navigating to the **Alerts > Rules** page of the Alauda Application Services, you can create the following alert policies corresponding to Kafka alerts.

<table border="">
  <tr>
    <th style={{width: '120px'}}>Type</th>
    <th>Monitoring Object</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><b>Metric Alert</b></td>
    <td>Predefined resource metrics, applicable only at the Pods level, such as Pods' memory usage rate.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><b>Custom Alert</b></td>
    <td>Kafka performance metrics.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

**Configure Alert Policies**: To enable alerts, please create an alert policy in the Alauda Application Services first. The alert policy describes the objects you wish to monitor, under what circumstances you wish to receive alerts, and how you want to be notified of related alerts.

**Handle Alerts**: When the interface indicates that there are rules in an alert state, please address them promptly.

**Bind Notification Policy**: In addition to viewing real-time notifications, the platform also supports sending alert information to relevant personnel via email, SMS, etc., notifying them to take necessary measures to resolve issues or prevent failures. The notification policy needs to be set in platform management.
