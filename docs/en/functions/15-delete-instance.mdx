# Delete Instance

Deleting an instance not only removes the created CR resources but also deletes the StatefulSet, ConfigMap, Secret, PersistentVolumeClaim, and other resources created by the Operator based on the CR resource.

## Procedure

<Tabs>
  <Tab label="CLI">
    - If the instance is not enabled for persistence, or if you need to retain the instance's persistent data, execute the following command to delete the instance:

    ```bash
    # delete kafka instance directly
    kubectl delete -n <namespace> rdskafka <name>
    ```
    - If you want to delete the instance along with its persistent volume claim, execute the following commands:

    ```bash
    # delete kafka instance directly
    kubectl delete -n <namespace> rdskafka <name>

    # patch delete pvc
    kubectl delete -n <namespace> pvc -l strimzi.io/cluster=<name>,strimzi.io/kind=Kafka
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab label="Web Console">
    1. Click on **Kafka** in the left navigation bar.

    2. Click on ***namespace name***.

    3. Select the instance to be deleted from the instance list and enter the instance detail page.
