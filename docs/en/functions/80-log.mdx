# Log Query

Understand the logs generated during the instance's operation from the container level, such as Kafka error logs. Proper use of logs can help you quickly identify issues and address faults and exceptions.

**Note**: To save disk space, the platform retains log records for a default duration of 7 days (up to a maximum of 30 days). The actual retention period can be set in the operation and maintenance center under **Logs** > **Policy Management**. If you need to keep the logs for a longer duration, please export them in a timely manner.

## Prerequisites

If the interface indicates no data, please deploy the **Log Collection Component** and ensure the component is running properly.
