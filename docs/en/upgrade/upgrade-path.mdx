# Upgrade Path

:::note
**Important**

This document provides the upgrade path principles and supported version compatibility for Alauda Streaming Service for Kafka.
For detailed upgrade instructions, please refer to the [Upgrade Alauda Streaming Service for Kafka](./upgrade.mdx).

## Overview
The Alauda Streaming Service for Kafka follows strict upgrade principles to ensure stability and compatibility when moving across versions.
All versions follow the same upgrade compatibility rules.

### Upgrade Principles
- **Minor Version Upgrades**:
  Upgrades between consecutive minor versions are supported.
  Example: `4.0.x ‚Üí 4.1.x`

- **Patch Version Upgrades**:
  Patch versions within the same minor version are fully compatible.
  Example: `4.0.0 ‚Üí 4.0.1`

- **Direct Cross-Version Upgrades**:
  Skipping multiple minor versions in a single upgrade is not recommended and may cause compatibility issues.

- **Kafka Version Compatibility**:
  Each Alauda Streaming Service for Kafka version supports a limited set of Kafka versions. Kafka upgrades must be aligned with the supported compatibility matrix.
